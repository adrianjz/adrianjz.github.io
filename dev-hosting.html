          <p>As I was thinking about how I would research different web hosts, I took into consideration that people have different needs and desires for a webhost. Someone inexperienced would probably appreciate having more help in the setup and having features that were convenient, though not explicitly necessary. Someone who had more experience with getting a website up and running and just wanted something to tinker with might be satisfied with a barebones setup. To consolidate these differences, I tried finding somewhere that compared webhosts by features, and I found a great resource at hostingadvice.com (Links to an external site.). In particular, it's overall reviews give a good picture of what each host excels at. Those can be found here: http://www.hostingadvice.com/reviews/ (Links to an external site.)</p>

<p> These are all paid hosts, and if I needed to make a choice based on this information, I would probably go with HostGator (Links to an external site.). Not only are they well-known, but they offer unlimited disk space, emails, and bandwidth on all their plans. That would be incredibly useful if you have a small website but plan to develop into something larger over time, since you won't have to worry about migrating to a host that gives you more bandwidth or more space. The monthly starting price is also good, at only $3.48 a month. (This price only seems to be in effect when clicking on HostGator from the link on HostingAdvice.)  My runner-up would be bluehost (Links to an external site.), since they seem to focus a good amount on customer experience. They also offer unlimited disk space and emails, but something that stood out to me was that they claimed to have &quot;1-on-1 training available&quot;. If you've never hosted anything before and are unsure where to start, this would be a valuable resource to have. They claim to start at $3.49 a month on hostingadvice, but it seems that's only for the first month. The regular rate is $7.99 a month from what I can tell.</p>

<p> Free hosts, on the other hand, can't offer as much as the paid hosting for obvious reasons. Despite this, I chose two options. The first one has a strange name, 000Webhost, and is a known free webhost that has been going on since 2007. I used it before and it had features like FTP and email. I can't remember why I decided not to use it recently, but it might have had something to do with transferring domains. Here is their website: https://www.000webhost.com/ (Links to an external site.)  The other free webhost I thought should be recognized was x10hosting. They have also been around for 10 years, so they are not going away anytime soon. I liked this one because it has a ton of configurability options, and they give you more control over email if you have your own domain. Their pages can be a bit slow on the free hosting, but I can't know for sure whether 000webhost or x10host is faster since I don't currently use 000webhost.com. You get what you pay for, I guess. Here's x10hosting's website: https://x10hosting.com/hosting-features (Links to an external site.)</p>

<p> I think above all, you have to know what your needs are when selecting a host. Make sure you see the final price upfront since many webhosts will have a discounted first month and make it harder to see the normal monthly cost. ...And once you start hosting a client's website, be sure to pick a host that can keep up with the demand you'll put on the server you're using!</p>
