          <p>For me, a lot of the terms sounded familiar, at least the ones in the beginning.  In middle school, I took a small class in which students were actually responsible for designing web pages for the teachers, so many terms were things I had come across before.</p>
<p>We would upload HTML files to the web server using FTP, but I don't think we ever used CSS to style them since we were only in the 8th grade.  I remember one guy who could do Javascript, but I haven't explored its depths personally.  I have a Raspberry Pi, and sometimes I use SSH to access it.  I often use code from Github to solve problems, but I haven't committed any code to it.  I will soon, though!</p>
<p>After that, things started sounding unfamiliar and more interesting.  The RESTful web services caught my attention, so I read up a bit on them.  <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069?pgno=1">This</a> was the most helpful link I found, though it is still a little bit dense.</p>
<p>A short summary of what I learned:  REST stands for Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for online media applications.  A service based on REST is a RESTful service.  The main focus of a RESTful service is managing resources on a server and providing a client/user with access to those resources.  The client and server talk to each other using messages.  The client sends a request message to the server, and if the server responds with the resource, the client gets access to it.  This is very generic wording, but it's hard to explain without going more in depth.  It's not that complicated, but the vocabulary takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>Another thing that caught my attention was nginx, since I'd seen that word before on webpages that didn't load correctly.  It turns out that nginx is a server that can be used for many things.  It is a mail server, reverse proxy server, and a generic Internet server that handles the TCP/UDP protocols.  It is used for managing the resources of a server to make sure that users can get the best experience possible without overwhelming the server.  To do so, it uses caching, load balancing, and lots of options for controlling who can access the server, as well as when.  I don't think I'll need it for a personal website anytime soon, but it certainly sounds like an enterprise would need it.  More information on nginx can be found <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I feel like I've explored enough for the time being, but I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone else comes up with.  Good luck!</p>
