          <p>This video reminds me of how fast technology is changing around us.  Not only that, but that same evolving technology often shapes things we don't think it touches.  It changes how we interact with our friends, loved ones, and even strangers halfway across the globe.  This highlights the importance of keeping the Web a safe and free place that fosters collaboration and sharing, as well as individual privacy.  We've got a lot that we can improve on, but it's fascinating and incredible to live in a time where we can do things people would have never thought possible before.  Also, it's strange how a video talking about the future of the Web can look so dated now, and it's only been about ten years.  I wonder what the Web will look like in ten more.  Actually, that depends on how we shape it.  That's a bit deep, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now for less philosophy and more practical information: I already had a bit of knowledge of XML, but I wanted to learn more about it.  I found out that it's incredibly useful because it is meant to be readable by humans and machines alike.  This makes it ideal for creating databases of things with many characteristics.  In addition, users aren't constrained to only a few tags or descriptions.  If you need another category, you make it yourself, meaning you have a great deal of flexibility.  Some XML examples can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_display.asp">here</a>, on the W3C site.</p>
<p>Another thing that caught my interest was when he mentioned stylistic elements being added to HTML.  We already read about bold, italics, and strong tags, but I wondered if there were any more similar to those.  I learned that there are tags to underline text, but it isn't recommended because it can confuse users and make them think something is a link.  In addition, it's possible to format text to make it subscript or superscript, which could come in handy if your website deals with any kind of science or math.  (Maybe even footnotes!)  I'll leave a link to the page where I found this information <a href="http://www.aspnetbook.com/basics/bold-italic-underline-strikethrough.php">here</a>.</p>
