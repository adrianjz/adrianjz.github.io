          <p>Understanding Your Market<br />
  Choosing a Product to Sell<br />
  Think about business model before thinking of software<br />
  Pick an area of interest<br />
  Physical vs. Virtual products<br />
  Product acquisition, storage, fulfillment<br />
  Create the goods yourself<br />
  Cheap, but time-sensitive<br />
  Wholesale/resale (large amount bought, markup)<br />
  Need capital for initial order<br />
  Drop-Shipping: Take orders, wholesaler sends product to customer<br />
  Marketing needed to separate store from competition<br />
  Manufacture product for direct sale<br />
  Make sure product will sell before ordering units<br />
  Virtual: Take time to create, but can be sold multiple times easily<br />
  Affiliate marketing, bring traffic to your site<br />
  Determine who you will market to!<br />
  Defining Your Audience<br />
  Look at it from customer&rsquo;s point of view<br />
  Create personas, representation of customers<br />
  Beginners vs. experienced users, cater differently<br />
  Focus on price vs. focus on experience<br />
  &ldquo;If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one&rdquo;<br />
  Choose WordPress theme to resonate with audience<br />
  Organizing Your Products<br />
  Sell individually, bundled, as add-ons, customizable, subscription<br />
  Gravity Forms vs. Ninja Forms<br />
  Gravity Forms = one fee, access everything, fixed cost<br />
  Ninja Forms = free, but charge for advanced functionality<br />
  Both successful, different clientele<br />
  Bundles = tells users what to expect<br />
  Beginner bundle = makes users confident as right choice<br />
  Give price break as incentives or add products as add-ons<br />
  E.g. If sell photographs, frames as add-ons<br />
  Configurable items like computers = make sure platform can handle<br />
  Subscriptions = make it easy to get your product, convenience<br />
  Offering Pre-Sales to Validate Your Product<br />
  People saying they&rsquo;ll buy differs from actually buying<br />
  Try to sell just one product<br />
  Kickstarter = newer avenue for testing waters<br />
  Crowdfunding = gauge interest and get pre-orders<br />
  Get feedback as to why people didn&rsquo;t pre-order<br />
  Incorporate feedback into your pre-order page<br />
  Have option to cancel pre-orders if needed<br />
  Social proof = important to build trust between you and people<br />
  Get validation = more sure footing that your time will pay off<br />
  Marketing Your Site<br />
  Using Marketing to Increase Site Traffic<br />
  Getting people to your store is difficult<br />
  Need to invest either Time or Money, or both<br />
  Easiest way = advertising<br />
  Google Adwords and Facebook Advertising = biggest players<br />
  Ads very effective, but require money to get started<br />
  Optimize your search engine ranking (SEO)<br />
  Content Marketing = create valuable content on your site<br />
  Once content is written, can continuously bring people to your site<br />
  Social media = great for sharing and creating relationships<br />
  Frame your message to the medium<br />
  Cost of Acquisition = effort and money invested in getting users<br />
  Understanding Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)<br />
  Cost of Acquisition = CoA<br />
  Customer Lifetime Value = CLV<br />
  Profitable when CLV > CoA<br />
  CoA = cost per visit / conversion rate<br />
  $1.00/click / 0.20 conversion = $5.00 CoA<br />
  Incentivize buying more, variety packs!<br />
  Newsletters to remind customers to return<br />
  Related products, etc.<br />
  Increasing CLV with Repeat Customers<br />
  Encourage people to come back<br />
  Create high-quality product = smaller CoA<br />
  However, cost of R&amp;D, branding, development higher<br />
  Advantage in regularly consumed products<br />
  Subscriptions = harder to get, but more profitable<br />
  Encourage customers to follow = maintaining contact<br />
  Don&rsquo;t just promote sales all the time, be useful<br />
  Newsletters helpful for seasonal businesses<br />
  Autoresponders = target customer for related items<br />
  Email if hasn&rsquo;t come back in awhile<br />
  Increasing Your Average Order Value<br />
  Premium version of products = higher quality goods<br />
  More expensive material or finish<br />
  Sell add-on that adds value to original purchase<br />
  Price anchoring: Start with high number, other items seem reasonable<br />
  One high-priced item makes others look more affordable<br />
  Upsell = similar but more expensive shown on same page<br />
  Cross-sell = promote a related item<br />
  Offer free shipping when a certain threshold exceeded<br />
  Tiered pricing = offer discounts for larger quantities<br />
  If only increase order value by 4%, still large amount in long run<br />
  Selling Products<br />
  Getting Paid<br />
  Website, Payment Gateway, Merchant Account, Bank = get paid<br />
  Website sends information to payment gateway<br />
  Payment gateway checks whether funds available<br />
  Traditional Gateway = merchant account draws funds -> bank<br />
  Modern gateway = combines payment gateway + merchant account<br />
  Brick &amp; Mortar stores still need merchant accounts<br />
  Credit cards require more security<br />
  Authorize = verify you can make charge<br />
  Capturing = actually transfer the funds<br />
  Only supposed to capture charge when you ship the item<br />
  Examining Your Needs<br />
  What type of payment do you want to accept?<br />
  PayPal and CC, different customers different preferences<br />
  Credit Cards, PayPal, Amazon, etc.<br />
  Foreign currency = exchange fees<br />
  Stripe = robust API, many options<br />
  How much risk willing to accept?<br />
  Onsite gateway = riskier than off-site gateway<br />
  Checkout broken into two parts, billing + shipping<br />
  Then redirected to enter CC info, then redirected back<br />
  Site never sees CC info = more secure<br />
  See supported options, recurring payments, modifying amounts<br />
  Checking out with PayPal<br />
  Options: PayPal Standard, Express, Advanced<br />
  WooCommerce = WordPress eCommerce Plugin<br />
  Full options of a cart<br />
  Checkout = PayPal selected<br />
  Redirected to PayPal, back to store, store notified of payment<br />
  Many eCommerce plugins offer PayPal Standard free<br />
  Checking out with Stripe<br />
  Stripe can get direct payment from customer using CC<br />
  No restrictions on eCommerce functionality<br />
  Stripe has a test mode, processes and shows success<br />
  Store confirms that transaction authorized -> user sees order received<br />
  Backend = new order for store<br />
  SSL Certificate needed when using Credit Cards!<br />
  Shipping, Orders, Taxes<br />
  Calculating Shipping Costs<br />
  Costs and options vary, even with digital distribution<br />
  Flat Rate shipping = per item cost, easy setup<br />
  Free shipping = popular with customers<br />
  Free shipping at price point = spend more to avoid paying shipping<br />
  Let customers know prominently<br />
  Estimates = get rates directly from shipping provider<br />
  Record weight and dimensions of every single item and box<br />
  Pass quote to user, calculate estimated costs<br />
  Pay attention to personas, give customers what they want<br />
  Managing Orders<br />
  Need to ship, track, refund, and complete orders<br />
  Explore advanced features like manual order creation<br />
  Special log in for shop manager<br />
  WooCommerce = takes care of order details<br />
  Extensions allow you to customize, such as print labels from home<br />
  Inventory error, need to make sure you can address them<br />
  Partial refunds possible?<br />
  Search orders by ID or reference number<br />
  Read up on refund process for your platform<br />
  Managing Inventory and Listings across Platforms<br />
  Sync between systems<br />
  Amazon = not your customers, no access to their data<br />
  However, Amazon has great reach and simple to set up<br />
  Services like Trade Gecko automate management of inventory<br />
  Webgility = more accounting focused<br />
  QuickBooks integration, SihpStation = all-around<br />
  Know that many solutions exist for your situation<br />
  Understanding Taxes<br />
  Some countries = federal tax, state tax, county tax, city tax<br />
  Get information from a TAX PROFESSIONAL!<br />
  If you have a nexus in a place, need to pay those taxes<br />
  Nexus = physical presence, like warehouse/storefront<br />
  CO store, warehouse in UT, need to collect in both<br />
  Depends on where customer is, usually only collect once<br />
  EU = tax-inclusive prices<br />
  US = tax-exclusive prices<br />
  TaxCloud = service for gathering tax rates for you<br />
  TaxJar = prepares sales tax<br />
  eCommerce platforms should support obtaining location for taxes<br />
  Certain products may be tax-exempt<br />
  Some food, clothing, medicine, or medical equipment are exempt<br />
  Before starting, reach out to a tax professional!<br />
  Collecting EU Value-Added Tax (VAT)<br />
  2015, must pay country&rsquo;s taxes if customer in EU<br />
  WooThemes.com = automatically detects location and adjusts prices<br />
  Country can be manually selected<br />
  If IP doesn&rsquo;t match country, ask for manual confirmation<br />
  WooCommerce + Easy Digital Downloads => Taxamo integration<br />
  Gumroad handles new EU VAT laws well<br />
  Detect location, confirm if necessary, collect taxes, and files for you<br />
  Securing Your Site<br />
  Understanding the Basics of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)<br />
  Security is important for three big reasons<br />
  Can be held liable for stolen credit cards<br />
  Can be fined if there is a breach<br />
  Lose customers&rsquo; trust if there is a breach<br />
  Secure-looking site increases conversions<br />
  Secure site = information encrypted, uses HTTPS<br />
  Use HTTPS requires SSL certificate<br />
  Even phone numbers should be secured for customers<br />
  WP Engine = allows you to purchase SSL through them<br />
  Installing SSL Certificate = technical, takes a few hours to sort<br />
  PCI compliance = industry standard on handling CC numbers<br />
  Most platforms for eCommerce neither PCI compliant nor violating<br />
  Woothemes.com has a guide for PCI compliance<br />
  WooCommerce can only handle 3 out of 12 points required<br />
  Rest is up to organization + host<br />
  Gumroad/Shopify take care of compliance<br />
  PCI compliance demanding, easier to start with an off-site gateway<br />
  Protecting Sensitive Data<br />
  Need to force users to use SSL, prevent regular HTTP traffic<br />
  Open up .htaccess file and make adjustments<br />
  OR let eCommerce platform handle it for you<br />
  &ldquo;Force secure checkout&rdquo; = good option<br />
  HTTPS SSL redirection = plugin to force all pages in HTTPS<br />
  Don&rsquo;t want to secure admin login? Use third-party system<br />
  Options = Jetpack&rsquo;s Single Sign on Feature or Clef<br />
  Clef = launches app on phone for verification<br />
  Let you log in without worrying about password being discovered<br />
  Lock EVERYTHING down before launch<br />
  Even one insecure transaction could be devastating<br />
  Using WordPress for eCommerce<br />
  Using Native WordPress Platforms<br />
  Many are open-source and GPL-licensed, can see and tinker with code<br />
  Most flexibility, some use Freemium model<br />
  Basic = free, advanced or niche functionality has a cost<br />
  Amazon requires Amazon add-on<br />
  WooCommerce = largest market share<br />
  Magento = next largest service<br />
  Downside to big players = update less often to avoid breaking<br />
  Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) has2.7% of WP market<br />
  iThemes Exchange = newer, but good brand backup<br />
  WP eCommerce was one of the first, but works well for some users<br />
  Ecommerce incredibly complex, make sure you have great developers!<br />
  Implementing Third-Party Platforms<br />
  Hosted platforms less flexible but require little oversight<br />
  Gumroad = for digital products<br />
  Can upload banners, descriptions, bundles, discount codes<br />
  No way to rearrange page elements :(<br />
  Gumroad supports free distribution, good for nonprofits<br />
  Gumroad Overlay = users don&rsquo;t know using Gumroad<br />
  Gumroad = no cart, only one product at a time<br />
  High transaction fee, 5% plus $0.25 per transaction<br />
  Stripe = 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction<br />
  If sell just one or two products, price justified for not having to spend time<br />
  Clickbank = handle payment like Gumroad<br />
  Also support affiliate payments, promoters get commission<br />
  Little control over product page, also higher product fees<br />
  7.5% plus $1.00 per transaction!<br />
  And one-time $50 per product fee<br />
  Shopify = well-known and respected<br />
  Shopify has a cart system! Don&rsquo;t even need WordPress<br />
  Monthly fee, tricky to integrate with WordPress<br />
  Some set up a subdomain for eCommerce<br />
  Shop domain controlled by Shopify<br />
  Have to translate design from WordPress to shopify<br />
  If premium/members-only area, trickier to integrate the two<br />
  Shopify stable, but lacks customizability<br />
  Testing and Optimization<br />
  Testing Your Site<br />
  Test product reviews display, live shipping quotes, payment, security<br />
  Most important = checkout process<br />
  Cache working? Multiple users?<br />
  Try logging in from multiple browsers, test each shipping method<br />
  Test different shipping rates<br />
  Make sure payment works and you get paid<br />
  Test logging in as users, discount added correctly, sign-up<br />
  Emails, order imports with integrating services<br />
  Small errors can be hard to find and fix, but fix to prevent chaos!<br />
  Optimizing Your Site<br />
  Every piece of website can be optimized!<br />
  Install analytics tool, Google Analytics = free!<br />
  Where users come from, etc.<br />
  Plugins: Google Analytics by Yoast<br />
  Detailed data comes at a premium, needs other plugins<br />
  eCommerce Tracking by Yoast is one possibility<br />
  Hotjar.com = makes a heatmap of user interactions<br />
  Lets you know where you should focus improvements<br />
  Test different tweaks, Optimizely can put into test groups<br />
  No such thing as perfect, will always be able to tweak more<br />
  Small tweaks pay off as big difference in site functionality<br />
