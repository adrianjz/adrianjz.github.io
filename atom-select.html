          <p>I had heard good things about both Sublime Text and Atom, as well as a few other editors, but these stood out to me because they were cross-platform. Since I usually use some version of Linux, cross-compatibility is important. In case I mess something up while experimenting in Linux, or if I just have to use a different workstation, I want to keep a consistent experience across operating systems as much as possible to work with my existing files. Then I saw that Sublime Text was proprietary and Atom was open-source, which made me lean more towards Atom. Both seem to be highly configurable, but Atom's is known as the &quot;hackable text editor&quot;, and advertised that it was &quot;hackable to the core&mdash;a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file,&quot; which was immensely appealing to me. I like being able to tweak things to get them to my liking, so based on these preferences, I decided to go with Atom.  To install Atom, I had to add a software repository and download the program. Not too hard. If anyone needs help on doing this in Linux, clearer instructions can be found here: http://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/08/05/install-atom-text-editor-ubuntu-16-04/ (Links to an external site.)</p>

<p> I'm enjoying Atom so far, so I think I'll stick with it!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>P.S. - The Google Drive setup didn't work for me at first. Since I'm running a version of Ubuntu, I don't think Google Drive is officially supported with a desktop client. However, I think I have it working now. I followed some simple instructions here: http://www.linuxtechi.com/access-google-drive-in-ubuntu-16-04/</p>

<p>... and it appears to be working.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I got this working after doing the first part of the HTML CodeAlong, so the first three chapters probably won't have any revision history since I copied them from my files onto Google Drive after I finished working with them.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Google Drive integration appeared to be working, but opening them in Atom wasn't working well. Opening them was okay, since they opened after an initial lag. Editing them, however, didn't sync the changes back to Google Drive.</p>
